# Music Recommender

This is based on the [Python Machine Learning Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eh4d6sabA0) from Mosh Hamedani.

It predicts the preferred music genre depending on age and gender using a decision tree from the Scikit-Learn library
using made-up data and illustrates the necessary steps for building a machine learning model:

1. import data
2. clean data (e.g. remove duplicates)
3. split data into training and test data (e.g. 80% training data, 20% test data)
4. create a model
5. train the model
6. make predictions (using the test data that's unknown to the model)
7. evaluate and improve

It also demonstrates how to save the model to a file and visualize the decision tree.
